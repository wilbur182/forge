# TD

**External memory for AI agents working across context windows.**

When an agent's context ends, its memory ends. TD captures structured work state—completed work, remaining tasks, key decisions, and uncertainties—so the next session resumes exactly where the previous one stopped.

**No hallucinated progress. No lost decisions. No repeated work.**

## Why Task Management for AI Agents?

AI coding agents face a fundamental constraint: **context windows reset between sessions**. Without external memory:

- **Agents hallucinate state** — guess what's complete vs. pending
- **Decisions are lost** — "why did we choose X over Y?"
- **Work gets repeated** — re-implement already-completed features
- **Handoffs break** — no structured way to pass context forward

TD solves this with **persistent, structured memory** via a local SQLite database:

| Feature | Benefit |
|---------|---------|
| **Structured handoffs** | Next session knows exact state (no guessing) |
| **Decision logs** | Prevent re-litigation of architectural choices |
| **Dependency tracking** | Manage multi-issue workflows and blockers |
| **Review workflows** | Enforce separation between implementation and approval |
| **File tracking** | Monitor what changed during work sessions |
| **Session identity** | Branch + agent scoping for consistent context |

**Built for:** Claude Code, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, and AI coding assistants.

## Installation

```bash
go install github.com/marcus/td@latest
```

**Requirements:** Go 1.21+

Initialize TD in your project:

```bash
cd your-project/
td init
```

This creates `.todos/db.sqlite` (automatically added to `.gitignore`).

## Quick Start for AI Agents

Add to your `CLAUDE.md` or agent configuration:

```markdown
# Agents: Mandatory: use td usage --new-session to see open work.

# Agents: Before context ends, ALWAYS run:
td handoff <issue-id> --done "..." --remaining "..." --decision "..." --uncertain "..."
```

**Start of every session:**

```bash
td usage --new-session   # View current state, see assigned work
```

**Before context window ends:**

```bash
td handoff td-abc123 \
  --done "Completed items" \
  --remaining "Pending work" \
  --decision "Why we chose this approach" \
  --uncertain "Open questions"
```

This structured handoff ensures the next agent or human session has complete context.

## Core Concepts

### Sessions

Every agent or terminal gets a unique session ID scoped by **git branch + agent type**. The same agent on the same branch maintains consistent identity across context resets.

```bash
td whoami                    # Show current session identity
td usage --new-session       # Start fresh session, view current work
td session "feature-work"    # Name current session
```

TD auto-detects: Claude Code, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, or manual terminal.

### Issues

Structured work items with types, priorities, and state tracking:

```bash
td create "Implement OAuth2 authentication" --type feature --priority P1
```

**Types:** `feature`, `bug`, `chore`, `docs`, `refactor`, `test`
**Priorities:** `P0` (critical), `P1` (high), `P2` (medium), `P3` (low)

### Issue Lifecycle

State machine with enforced transitions prevents invalid workflows:

```
open → in_progress → in_review → closed
         ↓              ↑
      blocked ──────────┘ (reject)
```

**Critical constraint:** The session that implements code cannot approve it. This enforces review separation—human or different agent session required.

### Epics and Dependencies

Model complex work hierarchies:

```bash
td epic create "Authentication system" --priority P0
td create "OAuth flow" --parent td-abc123
td dep add td-xyz789 td-abc456   # Issue depends on another
td critical-path                 # Show optimal work sequence
```

## Essential Commands

### Creating and Starting Work

```bash
# Create issues
td create "Add OAuth2 support" --type feature --priority P1
td epic create "Authentication system" --priority P0

# Start working
td start <issue-id>              # Begin work (open → in_progress)
td focus <issue-id>              # Set current working issue
td next                          # Show highest priority open issue
```

### Tracking Progress

```bash
td log "Implemented callback endpoint"
td log --decision "Using JWT - stateless scaling"
td log --blocker "Waiting for API key from ops team"
```

### Review Workflow

```bash
# Submit for review
td review <issue-id>             # Moves to in_review state

# Review others' work (different session required)
td reviewable                    # List issues awaiting review
td context <issue-id>            # View handoff state
td approve <issue-id>            # Approve and close
td reject <issue-id> --reason "Missing error handling"
```

### Querying and Searching

```bash
# Simple queries
td list                          # All open issues
td list --status in_progress     # Filter by status
td show <issue-id>               # Full details
td search "authentication"       # Full-text search

# Advanced queries
td query "status = in_progress AND priority <= P1"
td query "type = bug AND labels ~ security"
td query "rework()"              # Rejected, needs rework
td blocked                       # All blocked issues
td ready                         # Open issues by priority
```

### Dependencies

```bash
td dep add <issue> <depends-on>  # Create dependency
td depends-on <issue>            # What does this depend on?
td blocked-by <issue>            # What's waiting on this?
td critical-path                 # Optimal work sequence
```

## Structured Handoffs

**The handoff command is TD's most powerful feature.** It captures complete context for the next session:

```bash
td handoff td-a1b2 \
  --done "OAuth callback endpoint, token storage, login UI" \
  --remaining "Refresh token rotation, logout endpoint, error states" \
  --decision "Using httpOnly cookies instead of localStorage - more secure against XSS" \
  --uncertain "Should we support multiple active sessions per user?"
```

### What Handoffs Solve

Without structured handoffs, agents hallucinate progress and forget decisions. With handoffs:

- **Next session knows exact state** (no guessing)
- **Decisions are logged** (prevents re-litigation of "why did we do it this way?")
- **Uncertainties are captured** (humans or next agents can address)
- **Git state is recorded** (automatic SHA tracking)

### Handoff Fields

| Field | Purpose | Example |
|-------|---------|---------|
| `--done` | Completed and tested work | "API endpoint, auth middleware, tests" |
| `--remaining` | Specific pending tasks | "Error handling, rate limiting, docs" |
| `--decision` | Why this approach was chosen | "Using JWT over sessions - stateless scaling" |
| `--uncertain` | Open questions | "Should tokens expire on password change?" |

**Accepts multiple formats:**

```bash
# Flags (repeatable)
td handoff td-a1b2 --done "Item 1" --done "Item 2"

# From file
td handoff td-a1b2 --done @completed.txt

# From stdin
cat tasks.txt | td handoff td-a1b2 --remaining -

# YAML via stdin
td handoff td-a1b2 << EOF
done:
  - OAuth flow complete
  - Tests passing
remaining:
  - Token refresh
  - Logout endpoint
decisions:
  - Using httpOnly cookies for security
uncertain:
  - Multi-session support strategy
EOF
```

## Workflow Examples

### Single Issue Workflow

**Session 1 (Agent): Start work**

```bash
td usage --new-session        # See current state
td start td-a1b2
td log "Set up OAuth provider config"
td log --decision "Using Auth0 - better docs, existing integrations"
td handoff td-a1b2 \
  --done "Provider setup, environment config" \
  --remaining "Callback endpoint, token validation" \
  --uncertain "Should we support refresh token rotation?"
```

**Session 2 (Agent): Continue**

```bash
td usage --new-session        # Resume context
td context td-a1b2            # Review previous handoff
td log "Implemented callback endpoint"
td link td-a1b2 src/auth/*.go
td review td-a1b2             # Submit for review
```

**Session 3 (Human or different agent): Review**

```bash
td reviewable                 # List pending reviews
td context td-a1b2            # Read full handoff
td files td-a1b2              # Check modified files
td approve td-a1b2            # Approve and close
```

### Bug Fix with Full Context

```bash
# Create and investigate
td create "Login fails on expired tokens" --type bug --priority P0
td start td-bug123
td log "Reproduced: race condition in token refresh"
td log --decision "Adding mutex around refresh logic"

# Link relevant files
td link td-bug123 src/auth/refresh.go src/auth/middleware.go

# Handoff with uncertainty
td handoff td-bug123 \
  --done "Root cause found, mutex added, tests passing" \
  --remaining "Integration test, deployment verification" \
  --uncertain "Should we add circuit breaker for auth service?"
```

### Parallel Work with Sidecar Workspaces

TD integrates with Sidecar's workspace management for parallel development:

```bash
# In Sidecar:
# 1. Press 'n' - create workspace for feature branch
# 2. Press 't' - link TD task to workspace
# 3. Agent works in workspace, tracks with TD
# 4. Press 'r' - review in original workspace (different session)
```

This workflow ensures clean separation: implementation session cannot approve its own work.

## Live Monitoring

### Standalone TUI

```bash
td monitor
```

Interactive dashboard with:
- Real-time task visualization by status
- Board view with swimlanes (open, in_progress, in_review, blocked)
- Full-text search and filtering
- Statistics modal
- Keyboard navigation

### Sidecar Integration

Sidecar's **TD Monitor plugin** provides seamless integration:

- View all issues without leaving your editor
- Submit reviews directly (`r`)
- Navigate to issue details (`enter`)
- Real-time refresh on file changes
- Synchronized with Sidecar's workspace management

Open TD Monitor: press `t` in Sidecar's main view.

## Advanced Features

### TDQ Query Language

Powerful filtering with SQL-like expressions:

```bash
td query "status = in_progress AND priority <= P1"
td query "type = bug AND labels ~ auth"
td query "assignee = @me AND created >= -7d"
td query "rework()"          # Rejected issues needing rework
td query "stale(14)"         # No updates in 14 days
```

**Operators:** `=`, `!=`, `~` (contains), `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`, `AND`, `OR`, `NOT`

### File Tracking

Link files to issues and track changes:

```bash
td link td-a1b2 src/auth/*.go   # Record file SHAs
td files td-a1b2                # Show status: [modified], [unchanged], [new]
```

Status indicators show what changed since linking, helping reviewers focus on modified files.

### Boards

Query-based boards for organizing work:

```bash
td board create "Sprint 3" --query "labels ~ sprint-3"
td board show sprint-3
```

Boards update dynamically as issues match queries.

### Work Sessions

Group multiple issues under one work session:

```bash
td ws start "Auth refactor"
td ws tag td-a1b2 td-c3d4      # Auto-starts issues
td ws log "Shared migration"   # Log to all tagged issues
td ws handoff                  # Handoff all issues, end session
```

## Configuration

Zero-config by default. Optional environment variables:

| Variable | Purpose | Default |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `TD_SESSION_ID` | Force specific session ID | Auto-detected |
| `TD_ANALYTICS` | Disable usage analytics | `true` |

## Data Storage

**Local-first:** All data in `.todos/db.sqlite`. No cloud services, no sync, no accounts.

```
.todos/
├── db.sqlite          # All issues, logs, handoffs, sessions
└── sessions/          # Per-branch session state
```

**Privacy:** TD never transmits data externally. Everything stays on your machine.
